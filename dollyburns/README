= Introduction

DollyBurns is a plugin-based database dumping utility. It allows to dump
databases to some directory, with a date stamp, to be able to store several
copies from different days.


= Architecture

DollyBurns has one central configuration file, <tt>/etc/dollyburns.conf</tt>,
and a special directory, <tt>/etc/dollyburns.d</tt>, where one can store one
file for each database to dump. Thus, every application can install a
YAML-formatted DollyBurns configuration file in that directory and have its
databases dumped automatically.

DollyBurns is usually executed from <tt>cron</tt>. To that effect, a sample
<tt>cron</tt> file is bundled in the distribution
(<tt>dollyburns.cron.sample</tt>).  You are free to execute it by hand, or by
any other methods.


= Configuration

The main configuration file, <tt>/etc/dollyburns.conf</tt>, stores general
information, such as the dump directory, the default compression format, the
special ".d" directory, an email address to send warnings/errors to, etc. Its
format is simple YAML, with the following keywords:

[+DumpDir+] Directory to dump databases to.
[+DefaultDumpFormat+] Default compression format for the dumps.
[+ConfDir+] Absolute path for the ".d" directory. Usually,
            <tt>/etc/dollyburns.conf</tt>.
[+PluginDir+] Absolute path to the plugins. Usually,
              <tt>/usr/share/dollyburns/plugins</tt>.
[+NumDumps+] Number of dumps to keep.
[+FromEmail+] Email address for the +From+ header for notifications/warnings.
[+Email+] Email address to send notifications/warnings to.


== Plugin configuration

Each file in the ".d" directory is a description of a database to dump, in YAML
format. There are two important keys: +dumpType+ and +params+. The +params+
value is another hash with plugin-specific configuration. Some hash-keys are
pretty common, though:

 dumpType: Postgresql
 params:
  database: database_name
  user: admin
  password: mypassword
  email: somespecificemail@example.com
